Organizing your media with keywords and tags across file formats traditionally requires 3rd party system lockin because the app stores metadata in a separate system to organize your files. Working within pre-defined metadata such as EXIF isn't possible across all file formats, and many popular tools strip that data because of its inconsitencies. The one thing every file has is a filename. This app lets you define a keword schema, and it encodes it into the filename so it can be queried by this app or whatever system you choose to store your files in. No lock-in, no incompatibilites.
